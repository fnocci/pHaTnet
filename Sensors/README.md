These are the hardware & code component directories to the pHaT sensors:
  - Atlas: the pH and Temperature Probes from Atlas Scientific: plus your buffer solutions & calibration 
  - Arduino: the Arduino boards programmed to pick up data and send data out through BLE
  - nRF5: the Nordic nRF5 BlueTooth Low Energy chip on the Arduino board



For prototyping your pHaTnet Sensors cons of the following components:

    A Food-Safe pH probe connected to an EZO pH circuit via BNC connector
    A Waterproof Temperature probe connected to an EZO Temperature circuit via BNC
    A stainless steel well for submerging the Temperature probe in wet food product
    An Adafruit Bluefruit 32u4 Feather board with Nordic nRF51822 Bluetooth LE chip
    A featherboard prototyping board for connecting the EZO circuits to the pins on the Bluefruit 32u4
    A rechargeable LiPoly Battery
    A micro USB male to standard B-type male USB cable for programming the board & recharging the battery
    A Featherwing OLED display
    A 3D printed case
    Arduino code to run the Feather board
    Firmware to run the nRF5 chip on the Feather board
